What does it take to do data science in this day and age? I'm rusty, and this is going to be my blog to polish up my understanding.

The heart of data science certainly hasn't changed
* Find Data
* Clean Data
* Analyze to Find Insights
* Write about those insights

For today's exercise, finding some interesting data. Little bit of googling around took me to this page: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/free-datasets-for-projects/ and, mostly at random, decided to look into the World Bank (#12)

The World Bank has a detailed API, and Oliver Sherouse has been kind enough to write a Python wrapper around it. http://wbdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

* note that wbdata.get_indicator? in a notebook, is massively powerful. Drastically changes my workflow. (Admittedly more when you're getting to know a new library)

Separately, I'm going to start this little static, markdown based blog. Rendering pipeline for that.
